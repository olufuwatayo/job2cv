More About Dice Salary Predictions





Where does this estimate come from?
Dice predicts salary ranges based on the job title, location, and skills listed in individual job descriptions. In addition, we factor in the five most common skills associated with this job title. Our proprietary machine-learning algorithm uses more than 
							
								600,000
							
							 data points to make its predictions. To get the most accurate prediction of the salary you might earn, 
								
									
									
										customize
									
								 
								the prediction in your Dice profile.  Actual salary offered by employer may vary.  


How was this salary estimate calculated?
Dice's predictive salary model is a proprietary machine-learning algorithm. Unlike many other salary tools that require a critical mass of reported salaries for a given combination of job title, location and experience, the Dice model can make accurate predictions on even uncommon combinations of job factors.  The model does this by 
							
								recognizing
							 
							 patterns in the more than 
							 
								600,000
							
							 salary data points to infer how much each factor - job title, location, experience, education, and skills - will impact the salary.

Email Me This Job


Bind is a health technology and services company founded in 2016, and headquartered in Minneapolis, MN with offices in New York and San Francisco. Bind is health insurance for the way we live now. Unlike traditional health insurance that charges you for services you may never need or want, Bind is on demand: pay for what you need, not what you don't, and adjust your coverage when those needs change. Health coverage that's flexible, clear, and intuitive.
We are creative, collaborative, and a little bit fiery. The Bind team is comprised of like-minded individuals passionate about healthcare, and our cause is the collective act of rewiring it. We embrace new ideas. We're more wheel than cog. More spark than smoke.

Work with QA team to streamline testing through automation
Develop automation for application deployments beginning in our dev/test environments up to production
Keep current on relevant technologies, while always searching for the next emerging solution that could improve Bind's technology
Be a part of a rotating on-call role in case critical issues surface outside of business hours

Requirements

A minimum of 3 years in application and/or devops development, preferably in the health care field
Experience with build and dependency management tooling such as Gradle or Maven
Git distributed source code management (GitHub)
Automation of builds and deploys using continuous integration tools such as Jenkins

Experience with JVM environments (Spring/Spring Boot)
Linux / Unix administration experience

What We're Offering

Chance to join a new tech start-up aiming to fix the healthcare industry
Empowerment to shape new solutions disrupting healthcare while providing benefits and choice to its members
Flexible work-from-home schedule to support work-life balance
Opportunity to work w/ people who are motivated to go to work every day and make a difference
